In this project, we aim to discover dynamics (partial differential equations) from in situ videos of scanning transmission electron microscopy.
Mathematically, we want to find the best symbolic equation

that can describe the video. u is the intensity, a fuction of the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, and t-coordinate (time). RHS is the temporal derivative, and LHS is an unknown symbolic expression as a function of u, the 1st order derivative of u wrt x, u_x, the 1st order derivative of u wrt y, u_y, th three 2nd order derivatives, u_xx, u_xy, u_yy.
